Hello! This is my first project on Python. I developed it using pyTelegramBotAPI and MongoDB. I created Product, Category/Subcategory, User, Cart and OrderHistory models. Also, I created a seeder for Product and Category/Subcategory models. This telegram bot works on Google Cloud Platform with the help of web-hooking, but now it is deactivated.
